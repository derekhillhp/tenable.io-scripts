This repository contains python scripts to interact with the Tenable API
These scripts have been sanitized and in some cases rendered broken as some
of the code has been stripped out as it connected to internal systems.

These scripts come without any warranty and should be used to help you get
onto the path of understanding the API and give you a few examples on how
to extract that data.
